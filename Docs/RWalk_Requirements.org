* Questions.
** Open.
*** Smoothing. How do you handle boundary iterations. Assumption: reduce count of observations.
*** Smoothing. Is there a significance to the one-off discrepancy at the top of RW_AMP.xls at BG9. It only smooths 3 values instead of 4 as everywhere else.
*** Smoothing. Rolling. RW_AMP.xls smooths from the prior row. Ch. 1 begins from current row. Which should it be.
*** Smoothing. Should the number of values to smooth be configurable, or should it be fixed at 4. It can be a parameter with a default of 4, if you want to support changing it.
*** Smoothing. RW_AMP.xls really only smooths two values, not four, since the electrode column throws away the Michaelis-Menten correction.
*** Michaelis-Menten. Every iteration include two rows, an average and a Michaelis-Menten correction. Only the correction is carried forward.
**** DONE Is the Michaelis-Menten correction optional or required? Required, but the user may pass a value of 0 to vmax.

**** DONE If optional, is there any reason to see the intermediate value in the matrix? No. Just explain the calculation in the documentation.

*** DONE Michaelis-Menten. Are the parameters, Vmax and Km, constants defined by the calculation or should they be configurable by the user. The spreadsheet has entries for them, but is that only to serve as labeling for the formula. Answer: configurable; these are variables the user will manipulate to match the model curve to the experimental results.

*** Why does RW_AMP.xls extend to the right of the electrode.
*** DONE Is it always the same number of bins to the right and left of the electrode, or is it useful to configure differing bin counts to the right and left. It can be bidirectional or unidirectional.
CLOSED: [2019-01-22 Tue 19:38]
*** Ch. 1 bases the electrode value on its left neighbor only. RW_AMP.xls includes the right neighbor, too. Why. Is that a configurable option.
*** Release site. Ch. 1 enters the release value once here. Why does the release value of 2.75 repeat in interation 0 of RW_AMP.xls.
*** First bin from release site. Why is the contribution from the release site weighted .711 instead of averaging its neighbors. Check out later chapters of the tutorial.
*** Distance from electrode. Simulation reports absolute value. Wouldn't this be better signed.
*** Dead space. I figured it by bin count. The user must specify based on their argument for bin size.
*** In the cyclic voltammetry simulation, why is there dead space in bins 31-38 in addition to the 4µ around the electrode. There is no corresponding gap on the left side of the electrode.
* Tasks.
** DONE Write a function for Michaelis-Menten correction.
CLOSED: [2019-01-15 Tue 11:36]
** Arguments.
*** Diffusion coefficient. Default: value for DA.
*** Bin size. Default: 2.00 µm.
*** Release. Default: 2.75 µM.
*** Bidirectional. Default: TRUE. Provide option of simulating one side of the electrode only.
** Write a function to calculate distance from the electrode.
** DONE Build a random walk matrix. (No smoothing.) Included smoothing, but it is optional, you can pass a smoothing argument of 1.
CLOSED: [2019-01-30 Wed 10:55]
** DONE Build a vector of times, given a random walk matrix and a duration of iterations.
CLOSED: [2019-01-30 Wed 10:55]
*** Is this necessary? Probably not. You could calculate the time buckets when plotting. No, put the time series in the data frame.
*** Maybe you could name the rows with the time dimension, if someone wanted to see that in the matrix. I don't really like that, because I want to build assumptions into the data. How about a reporting routine; better.
** Build a report function that presents the spreadsheet the way Dave is accustomed to seeing it. Then you could calculate the times. The times should not reside in the random walk matrix. Yes, they should, and that's what I did.
** DONE Duration of iteration. Function based on diffusion coefficient and bin size.
CLOSED: [2019-01-30 Wed 10:57]
** LAFF. See if you can process matrices with a LAFF approach so you don't get confused about indexes.
** Write a test bed comparing matrix output to sample simulations.
** DONE Change the time iteration input to a time length input. Changing bin length changes the duration necessary for each time iteration.
CLOSED: [2019-01-30 Wed 10:57]
** DONE Put the time series of simulations in a column of the data frame instead of in the row names.
CLOSED: [2019-01-30 Wed 10:57]
** Convert observations to moles.
* Notes.
** Diffusion coeffecient determines duration of iteration.
** Michaelis-Menten correction uses duration of iteration.
* Lessons learned
** Put time series in a data frame column, not the row name.
** ggplot needs a long data frame, not wide.
