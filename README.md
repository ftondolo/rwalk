rwalk
=====

**This is a fork of pnojai's original repo for the sake of sharing the computational load, this is not necessarily bleeding edge!**
This package is under development.

This is a minimal build with incomplete documentation.

The package rwalk consists of tools for random walks and Schmitz/Sulzer modified random walks for simulations of electrochemical detection of neurotransmitter release and reuptake. Developed with the Sulzer Lab at Columbia University.
